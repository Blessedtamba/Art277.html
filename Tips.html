<h2>
  “Fully vaccinated” doesn’t mean “immune to COVID-19”
</h2>
<p>
  As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be 
feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard 
down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected. <br>
Dr. Cardona explains. <br>
“‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best 
protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100% 
protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being 
exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.”
</p><br>
<h2>
  Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others, 
including other vaccinated people? 
</h2>
<p>
  While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds 
that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines. <br> 
“The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may 
not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data 
and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.”
